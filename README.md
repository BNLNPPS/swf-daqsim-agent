# ePIC streaming computing testbed: the DAQ agent simulator

## About
* __Work Title__: _swf-daqsim-agent_
* __Purpose__: To simulate the state machine of the ePIC DAQ, including its components interacting
with the data management, prompt processing and ast monitoring systems.
* __Tools__: We use _SimPy_ which appears to be well suited for the task. It's a discrete event
simulation framework written in Python.
