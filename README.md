# ePIC streaming computing testbed: the DAQ agent simulator

## About
* __Work Title__: _swf-daqsim-agent_
* __Purpose__: To simulate the state machine of the ePIC DAQ, including its components interacting
with the data management, prompt processing and ast monitoring systems.
* __Tools__: We use _SimPy_ which appears to be well suited for the task. It's a discrete event
simulation framework written in Python.


## The Simulation

### Time handling

We make use of the real time features of SimPy. The default time unit is 1.0s, i.e.
that's what will determine the speed of actual execution that includes a variety of
delays and timeouts defined in the units of time. There is a way to speed up the
simulation or slow it down, by introducing a time scaling factor. In this package,
the time "starts" when the main simulation class is instantiated, corresponding
to 0.0 on the time axis.

### The Schedule

The critical part of the simulation is the process of state transitions in the DAQ.
For simulation purposes, we define "schedule" as a list of points on the timeline,
with assigned states (and possibly sub-states to be added later). The points are
defined as tuples of (weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds) for ease of human interaction
but internally these data are converted to seconds (as floats).
