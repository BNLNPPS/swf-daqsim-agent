# The daqsim-agent schedule (schedule-rt.yml) defines the states and substates of the DAQ system,
# the time spans for each state and substate, and the transitions between them.
# The schedule is used to control the simulation of the DAQ system, allowing it to move
# through different states and substates, simulating the data acquisition process.
#
# Time span (duration) format is tuple with no spaces: weeks,days,hours,minutes,seconds
